            <br>
            <br>
           <span> 
			It’s not your imagination—hemp seed oil is everywhere these days. Pharmaceutical companies, the medical community, and consumers are all touting the pros of hemp seed oil. While it may seem that hemp seed oil products appeared out of nowhere, the hemp plant itself has been around for centuries. Even George Washington (along with a few other founding fathers) grew hemp for industrial use. Hemp is truly a multi-purpose, miracle plant with hundreds of uses in food, beauty products, textiles, and so much more! Plus, this plant is so robust, every part of it—seeds, stalks, roots, and leaves—is beneficial. One of the most popular uses for hemp seed oil is in body care products.

              "If you’re wondering why such an amazing plant has been under the radar for decades, that’s because of its misguided connection to the marijuana plant. The confusion stems from the fact that hemp and marijuana are two varieties of the same plant species: Cannabis sativa. Since the word “cannabis” has been associated with marijuana for decades, this leads to some unfair comparisons. The difference lies in the amount of THC in each variety. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the psychoactive compound in marijuana that creates the “high” feeling. In fact, for all the things that hemp can do, the one thing it cannot do is get you high because hemp does not contain any THC. While the reasons behind hemp’s “guilt by association” are complicated, let’s just say that as government farm bills have loosened the restrictions on growing and cultivating hemp and CBD, the social stigma against these products is fading. Now, everyone is discovering the therapeutic benefits of hemp seed oil."

            <h6 class="sub-heading">Are Hemp Seed and CBD Oils the Same Thing?</h6>
            You may see hemp seed oil and CBD oil used interchangeably but there are some differences. CBD oil is derived from the flowers and leaves of the plant, while hemp seed oil is derived from—you guessed it—the seeds. Cold-pressed hemp seed oil is obtained from crushing the seeds with a steel press, which is preferable to an expeller method that uses heat or chemicals that can affect the quality of the oil. Always purchase unrefined hemp seed oil, as refined oils are treated or purified with chemicals that can actually negate the oil’s benefits. <br>
            <br>
            Another difference is that CBD stands for Cannabinoid which is a naturally occurring substance that imparts a feeling of relaxation and calm. And, while CBD oil contains a trace amount of THC (0.3%) it is not enough to create a high or psychoactive effect so, like hemp, it is safe to use.<br>

            <h6 class="sub-heading">What Can I Use Hemp Seed Oil For?</h6>
            Hemp seed oil has many benefits thanks to its composition of essential minerals and vitamins that help promote healthy, hydrated skin and hair, both inside and out. With antioxidants, as well as omega fatty acids and a healthy amount of protein, hemp seed oil can be instrumental in building and repairing hair and skin tissues.<br>
            <br>

            <h1 class="lower-heading">Skin Care</h1>
            Hemp seed oil helps regulate skin’s oil production. When skin is too dry, it overproduces oil. When it’s too oily, it can trap bacteria in the pores. By regulating oil production, hemp seed oil keeps skin balanced and helps reduce acne. Hemp seed oil is also non-comedogenic, which means it moisturizes without clogging your pores. Hemp seed oil helps fight the signs of aging, and protects your skin against environmental stressors to make it look and feel amazing. Other benefits:<br>
